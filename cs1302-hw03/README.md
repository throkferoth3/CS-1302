# hw03 Interfaces (ADTs)

![Approved for: Spring 2021](https://img.shields.io/badge/Approved%20for-Spring%202021-success)

This class exercise is designed to get you acquainted with Interfaces in Java.
When a seasoned programmer or potential employer asks you if you know 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), they do not mean, "do you know classes and objects?" 
Instead, they mean, "do you know the pillars of OOP?" The pillars of OOP are interfaces, 
inheritance, and polymorphism. In this exercise, we continue the exploration of interfaces 
and interface-based polymorphism. 

## Prerequisite Knowledge

* A basic understanding of creating and implementing interfaces in Java.
* [CSCI 1302 Interfaces Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/interfaces/interfaces.md)

## Course-Specific Learning Outcomes

* **LO2.e:** (Partial) Utilize existing generic methods, interfaces, and classes in a software solution.
* **LO3.b:** Create class, interface, method, and inline documentation that satisfies a 
set of requirements.
* **LO3.c:** Generate user-facing API documentation for a software solution.
* **L04.b:** Utilize interface-based polymorphism in a software solution.

## Questions

In your notes, clearly answer the questions in the following exercise steps. All instructions assume that you are 
logged into the Odin server.

**NOTE:** For each step, please provide in your notes the full command that you typed to make the related 
action happen along with an explanation of why that command worked. Some commands require multiple options. 
It is important to not only recall what you typed but also why you typed each of them. If context is necessary 
(e.g., the command depends on your present working directory), then please note that context as well.
You won't need to submit your notes in your final submission. However, if done properly, your exercise notes 
will serve as a helpful study guide for the exam.

## Exercise Steps

### Checkpoint 1 Steps - Getting Started

1. Use Git to clone the repository for this exercise onto Odin into a subdirectory called `cs1302-hw03`:

   ```
   $ git clone https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw03.git
   ```

1. Change into the `cs1302-hw03` directory that was just created and look around. There should be
   multiple Java files contained within the directory structure. To see a listing of all of the 
   files under the `src` subdirectory, use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find src
   ```
   
   For each Java file under the `src` subdirectory, fill out a row in a table similar to the 
   following in your notes:

   **Note:** If a class is not an interface and does not implement an interface, write `NA` in the second
   column. Also, the "Depends On" column should list any Java types in the `cs1302.hw03` package that the file
   is dependent upon. 

   | Name of the Java file | Interface or Implementing Class? | Fully Qualified Name (FQN) | Depends On |
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|
   |-----------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|------------|

1. Read through the Javadoc comments in the `Drivable` interface and write down the names of the 
   abstract methods in your notes.

1. Run the given code through `checkstyle` using the `check1302` command and fix any errors that it gives.
   Remember to use the [1302 Style Guide](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide) as a reference
   for the various types of errors that may pop up.
   
1. Generate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package. 
   Host the documentation on Odin using `cs1302-hw03-doc` as the name for your symbolic link.
   What is the URL to your hosted website?

1. Look at the `speedUp` method in the `Car.java` file. Compare the Javadoc comment for the
   method in that file to the documentation listed for that method in the API documentation
   website. Notice that there is no Javadoc comment in the source code. However, a comment still
   shows up on the website. How is this possible?

### Checkpoint 2 Steps

1. Make sure that you are still in the `cs1302-hw03` directory. Compile `Drivable.java` and place the compiled
   code under the preexisting `bin` directory. To see a listing of all of the files under the `bin` subdirectory, 
   use the `find` command as follows:
   
   ```
   $ find bin
   ```
   
   Notice that interfaces are compiled the same way as classes. In your notes, write down the path for the
   `Drivable.class` file that the compiler generated based on the output of `find`.
   
1. Compile `Car.java`. Remember to set the classpath appropriately so `javac` can locate dependencies. 

   *Uh-oh*. (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ 

   * Don't stress! You're expected to see the compile-time error below:
   
   ```
   error: Car is not abstract and does not override abstract method slowDown(double) in Drivable
   public class Car implements Drivable {
          ^
   1 error
   ```
   
   Note: the expected error is not "package does not exist" or 
   "cannot find symbol". If you received one of these errors, check your compilation line for mistakes.
   
1. Why did you receive the intended compile-time error above? Notice it says `Car` does not override
   one of the methods in `Drivable`. Must be a typo. **Hint:** check spelling and capitalization.
   
   Modify `Car.java` to fix the error and recompile. ┬─┬ノ( º _ ºノ)
   
1. Compile and execute `Driver.java`. It should run properly once `Car.java` is compiled. For now, we only
   have a single class (`Car.java`) that implements `Drivable`. Notice that the `test` method in `Driver.java`
   takes an argument of type `Car`. For now this is okay--just observe what is going on.
   
1. Think of something else in real life that is capable of being driven (other than a car). This can be
   anything - have fun with it. :)

1. Now, add a class to the `cs1302.hw03.impl` package that represents your new drivable type. That type should
   be something that is capable of being driven (speeding up and slowing down) and therefore a perfect 
   candidate for a class that implements the actions in the `Drivable` interface. Make sure that your 
   class properly implements the interface. Also make sure that your class compiles. Here is a small 
   list of things you should do:
   
   1. Properly implement the interface. 
   1. Add appropriate Javadoc comments and update your API documentation website. 
   1. Compile your class.
   1. Run your program through `check1302` to make sure it follows the style guidelines.
   
   What is the command that you used to compile your class? 
   
1. **Tricky (hint below):** Update `Driver.java` to test your new class. Modify the existing `test` method (don't overload the method 
   by creating a separate method with the same name) so it can be used to 
   test `Car` objects and objects of the new type that you just created (what do `Car` objects and objects
   of your new type have in common?). You should not change the name of the method, its return type, or the 
   number of parameters. However, you may modify other parts of the method signature as well as the method's 
   body, as needed. Be sure to update the Javadoc comments in the `Driver` class where necessary. 
   In your notes, summarize the changes you made.
   
   **Hint:** If you're stuck on this step, it is similar to the `gatherTotalDonations` method in the
   [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kcBV6tlg44I) on Interfaces provided in the 
   [1302 Interfaces Tutorial](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-tutorials/blob/master/interfaces/interfaces.md).
   The `gatherTotalDonations` method used an array of `Donator` references. Your method will just need a single
   `Drivable` reference.
   
1. Regenerate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package using
   the Javadoc tool. You should not need to recreate the symbolic link, assuming it still exists from
   a prior step.

### Checkpoint 3 Steps

1. Add an abstract method `stop` to the `Drivable` interface, including appropriate Javadoc comments
   for _what_ the method should do. Recompile the interface _as well_ as any code that depends on 
   the interface.  Did any compilation problems occur?  If so, where and why?

1. Without further modifying the code in the interface, fix the errors observed in the previous step. 
   If you find yourself writing additional methods in any of the other Java source code files, then 
   be sure to include appropriate Javadoc comments. For each affected file, list the commands you used 
   to verify that you fixed the errors. Repeat this step, as needed, until the code compiles.

1. Regenerate the API documentation website for all of the code in the `cs1302` package.

1. Run the 1302 `checkstyle` program using the `check1302` command on all `.java` files. If errors are 
   reported, look up each error 
   message in the [Style Guide](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-styleguide), fix the error, and 
   repeat until no style errors remain.
   
1. Take a minute to notice your `stop` method in the various places that it appears in the API 
   documentation website that you regenerated in the previous step.

1. Do not type the following command:

   ```
   $ nc towel.blinkenlights.nl 23
   ```
   
   The `nc` command provided above is not related to the exercise. 
   If you type it in, then you may end up wasting time.
   The command connects you to a highly addictive form of entertainment provided Sten S. Stans, 
   an elite Dutch Unix engineer.

### Submission Steps

**Each student needs to individually submit their own work.**

1. Create a plain text file called `SUBMISSION.md` directly inside the `cs1302-hw03`
   directory with the following information.

   1. Your name and UGA ID number; and
   1. The full link to the website generated in this exercise.
   
   Here is an example of the contents of `SUBMISSION.md`.
   
   ```
   Sally Smith (811-000-999)
   https://webwork.cs.uga.edu/~user/cs1302-hw03-doc
   ```

1. Change directories to the parent of `cs1302-hw03` (e.g., `cd ..` from `cs1302-hw03`). If you would like
   to make a backup tar file, the instructions are in the submissions steps for [hw01](https://github.com/cs1302uga/cs1302-hw01).
   We won't repeat those steps here and you can view them as optional.
   
1. Use the `submit` command to submit this exercise to `csci-1302`:
   
   ```
   $ submit cs1302-hw03 csci-1302
   ```
   
   Read the output of the submit command very carefully. If there is an error while submitting, then it will displayed 
   in that output. Additionally, if successful, the submit command creates a new receipt file in the directory you 
   submitted. The receipt file begins with rec and contains a detailed list of all files that were successfully submitted. 
   Look through the contents of the rec file and always remember to keep that file in case there is an issue with your submission.

   **Note:** You must be on Odin to submit.
