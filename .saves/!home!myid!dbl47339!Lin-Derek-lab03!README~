How to run and compile:
    1. make compile
    2. make run
    3. make clean (optional)

Pointer Practice:
1. a) 1 byte
   b) 8 bytes
   c) 2 bytes
   d) 8 bytes
   e) 4 bytes
   f) 8 bytes
   g) 8 bytes
   h) 8 bytes
   i) 8 bytes
   j) 8 bytes

2. a) 0x7ffc32170874
   b) 0x7ffc32170878
   c) 0x7ffc3217087c
   d) 0x7ffc32170880
   e) 0x7ffc32170884

   a) 0x7ffd34e12f14
   b) 0x7ffd34e12f18
   c) 0x7ffd34e12f1c
   d) 0x7ffd34e12f20
   e) 0x7ffd34e12f24

   a) 0x7ffda412a284
   b) 0x7ffda412a288
   c) 0x7ffda412a28c
   d) 0x7ffda412a290
   e) 0x7ffda412a294

   f) The output of each run is different.
      This is because the address of i
      is being printed, and the program does
      not decide the address of i before it runs.
      The operating system randomly decides the
      memory addresses during each runtime.
      Adding values to the pointer changes the memory
      locations. Since the size of an int is 4,
      it adds 4 to whatever the current memory address
      is. As long as the values are being added to the
      pointer without
